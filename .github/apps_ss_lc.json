Fixed an issue where some apps displayed a black screen in versions 3.5.0/3.5.1. Fixes 543, 594.\r\n2. Fixed an issue where some apps bypassed \"SecItem*\" hooks using \"dlsym\". Fix 339.\r\n3. Fixed issues with signing and patching apps when the app's main executable header was nearly full, by skipping certain patches. Fixes 606, 608.\r\n4. Fixed physical keyboard input not working in multitasking mode. Fix 524.\r\n5. Fixed a crash caused by receiving malformed OCSP responses. Fix 617.\r\n6. Fixed a crash caused by signals being converted to SIGKILL when TPRO switched to read-only mode. TPRO is now switched to read-only only after overwriting the main executable path. Fixes 310, 519.\r\n7. Fixed an issue where some apps couldn\u2019t store UserDefaults by implementing a new UserDefaults hook. Fix 633.\r\n8. Fixed a crash in some apps due to symbol name conflicts with system symbols on iOS 26, by preloading affected libraries. Fix 667.\r\n9. We adopted a new method to mitigate an issue where some apps were being killed in the background with code 0xdead10cc.\r \nRemoved Features\r\n1. Store patching: This has been removed.
